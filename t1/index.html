        <h3>Hi! My name is Gabriel Lüders</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate Computer Science undergraduate at the Federal
          University of Paraná, with an extensive eight-year background in
          diverse facets of computer science. Proficient in developing a wide
          range of systems, from CLI tools using C and C++ to sophisticated
          full-stack applications employing vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
          modern frameworks like React and Next.js. Experienced in designing and
          implementing microservices and support services, mainly utilizing
          Node.js and Golang, to enhance the functionality of main applications
          in various business settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've made this little page just as an assignment for the Web
          Development course at the Federal University of Paraná. Feel free to
          check out the other pages in the sidebar and learn a bit more about me
          and my projects.

        <h3>NG Informática - TOTVS Software Partner</h3>
        <h3>Software developer</h3>
        <h4>July 2021 - January 2024</h4>
        <p>
          As a Full Stack Web Developer at NG Informática - TOTVS Software
          Partner, I enhanced the SaaS application, Quirons, utilizing Node.js,
          ReactJS, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contributions included developing the backend with Node.js for
          seamless operations, leading frontend development with ReactJS for an
          intuitive UI, and designing GraphQL endpoints for efficient data
          exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          I integrated various external systems, optimizing app
          interoperability, and managed PostgreSQL databases with TypeORM for
          improved data processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I developed scalable microservices and maintained our
          infrastructure with Docker, contributing significantly to the
          application's robust and modular architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my role, I also leveraged Node.js and Docker-based microservices to
          enhance Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and product delivery
          management within the Quirons system. This approach significantly
          improved operational efficiency, serving 2128 users across 672
          organizations, managing 296k employee registrations and facilitating
          the delivery of 114k PPE items out of roughly 44k registered products.
        </p>
        <p>
          This role advanced my expertise in full-stack development, focusing on
          creating efficient, scalable web applications for diverse business
          needs.

        <h3>Turing Digital</h3>
        <h3>Software developer intern</h3>
        <h4>August 2020 - July 2021</h4>
        <p>
          At Turing Digital as a Software Developer Intern, I specialized in
          Python and Pandas to process financial data for an investment
          simulator and I designed RESTful endpoints with Flask, enabling
          seamless data integration into web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise in Docker improved our project's scalability and
          maintainability. Collaborating with frontend teams, I contributed to
          React.js and Next.js web pages, enhancing user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I managed a MongoDB database, optimizing data storage
          and processing. My role was pivotal in developing data-driven features
          for the company’s website, significantly advancing our investment
          simulation tool.

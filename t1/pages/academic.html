        <h3>Scientific resarch in systems security</h3>
        <h4>Mentored by André Grégio (gregio@inf.ufpr.br)</h4>
        <h4>October 2019 - December 2020</h4>
        <p>
          At the Federal University of Paraná, my involvement in systems
          security research culminated in the development of a project named
          "Breaking Good," which aimed at crafting adversarial malware to test
          and improve the resilience of static antivirus defenses against
          evasion techniques. The project was notable for several
          accomplishments. We engineered malware capable of evading detection by
          closely mimicking the behavioral patterns of legitimate software, a
          breakthrough that significantly challenges conventional antivirus
          methodologies. Our innovative work received recognition through its
          publication at the Brazilian Security Symposium (SBSeg), marking a
          significant milestone in our research journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further validating the effectiveness of our approach, we secured a
          victory in an evasion competition, an achievement that is documented
          in the publication
          <a href="https://secret.inf.ufpr.br/papers/roots_mlsec20.pdf"
            >roots_mlsec20</a
          >. This victory underscored the practical implications and potential
          of our research in real-world cybersecurity challenges. In addition to
          these accolades, we committed to contributing to the broader
          cybersecurity community by making our findings and methodologies
          available on GitHub under the repository
          <a href="https://github.com/ludersGabriel/BreakingGood"
            >Breaking good</a
          >. This open-source sharing initiative aimed at fostering further
          research and development in the field by providing a base for other
          researchers to build upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a collaborative effort, involving a team of experts
          whose contributions were instrumental to its success. Details of this
          collaboration can be found at
          <a href="https://secret.inf.ufpr.br/">secret</a>, a platform that
          highlights the collective expertise and dedication of our team.
          Through "Breaking Good," we showcased our ability to develop
          innovative solutions to critical cybersecurity challenges,
          contributing to the ongoing evolution of more secure systems. For a
          more comprehensive insight into our research and findings, I invite
          interested parties to explore our publication on ResearchGate at
